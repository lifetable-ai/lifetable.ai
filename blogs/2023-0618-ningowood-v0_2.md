# [Ningowood](http://ningowood) v0.2.0: Add the missing community to the spreadsheet database ecology

![](./public/static/showcase-20221126.webp)

## Why you need: About the numerous data

Through every day deep immerse in the era of Internet Web 2.0, we meet and create so much data, but it still has the not rejoicing situation in which data is separated everywhere.

Take a real-world scenario, for example, how much money did we spend on physics and digital games, when is the last time we go to the cinema to watch a movie shown in IMAX laser, and what places have my friend and I visited on the previous trip...

how to plan my future by tracking everything that just happened...?

We want to track, sort, filter and group. We want to see it

and more.

Yes, there already have some awesome tool to track all data by your own (AirTable is what I really like), and both have an brilliant API workflow to communicate with other tools. But except you must track them manually(which u must define the data struction one by one) and painfully(the data relations is so hard to link about globally), you still got the final big question, where should all the data landing?

## INFOM structured: From multiple apps to spreadsheet databases.

> We want to find the all-in-one tool.

> From using multiple apps in multiple places to using spreadsheet databases in one place.

> Notion, AirTable

## Retrieve the data that belongs to you

## What we will do in the future

> Thanks to Single SPA and the Micro Frontend ecosystem, we now have the sights and ability to build so many micro-app in one page for your comfortably usage.

* Use different common model (Time | Quantity | Cost | Location | People | Notes..) to track any entities you want (Games | Films & Open Source Communitiesâ€¦).
* Share with others: the game-time u laughed with your friend, the social-time u just learn from others and even the food you just cooked for your lover, anything you track can directly share to others, and stored in her/his own database (Datas can sync with each other related and can have Open API auth to anywhere u want to use)!
* No-Code Editor and even powerful Canvas to draw, or build any workflow you want for your own data.
* Powerful community work for you every-time: Following the Official API, any of we can create any micro-tools, and then published directly to your target users.
* Using the leading-edge techniques, build and find every data relations for you.
* Change any UI you like. Even the official Login UI, navbar UI, whereever you see about, you can change it to another and share with others. Powered by Headless UI, Single SPA and more to build this plugin System.
* Abundance 3rd part API, because we are not autistic to code. AirTable, Notion, Strapi, IMDB, LetterboxD, GOG, Steam, Github, Zapier, Dropbox... and more to come.
* And finally, all the data belongs to you. You can choose where to store (in Cloud or in your Own Computer). Export to any format like Excel, PPT, and more!

## The future action in the AI era

## Development togehter

> Group is just beginning, welcome your contribute!

* Git clone this monorepo
* Independently install node_modules in both microfrontends/apps* and microbackends/apps*
* Before `be-root` repo start, run PostgreSQL in your machine first.
  * Then, 
* Any question new, please discusstion in this repo or contact the community by joining the group (See below).

## Open Source, or charge?

Open source is the most important way where we study all the leading-edge technique knowledege. We don't want to leave it. When the Open Source is controlling this Software World, so many open source project earned what they deserved. Let's see where we can get.

## Metaverse is not died, long live with the XR experience.

JavaScript is everywhere, build it in XR is just the beginning for our world.
